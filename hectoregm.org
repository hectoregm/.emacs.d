* Configuration
  Emacs is a special beast. Taming it takes a lot of care. In an
  attempt to document/explain/share with the rest of the world, this
  is my attempt at configuration as a literate program. It also shows
  off the awesome power of org-mode, which makes all of this possible.
** User details
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: user-info
   :END:

   Emacs will normally pick this up automatically, but this way I can
   be sure the right information is always present.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq user-full-name "Hector E. Gomez Morales")
     (setq user-mail-address "hectoregm@gmail.com")
   #+end_src

** Key bindings
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: key-bindings
    :END:

    Miscellaneous key binding stuff that doesn't fit anywhere else.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq mac-option-modifier 'super)
      (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)
    #+end_src
